# ProHint, A Static Code Analysis Tool for OpenEdge

ProHint is a community-driven tool to detect errors and potential problems in
OpenEdge code and to enforce your team's coding conventions. It is very
flexible so you can easily adjust it to your particular coding guidelines and
the environment you expect your code to execute in. ProHint is open source and
will always stay this way.

## Our goal

The goal of this project is to help OpenEdge developers write complex programs
without worrying about typos and language gotchas.

Any code base eventually becomes huge at some point, and simple mistakes—that
would not show themselves when written—can become show stoppers and waste
hours of debugging. And this is when static code analysis tools come into play
and help developers to spot such problems. ProHint scans a program written in
OpenEdge and reports about commonly made mistakes and potential bugs. The
potential problem could be a syntax error, a bug due to implicit type
conversion, a leaking variable or something else.

## Reporting a bug

To report a bug simply create a
[new GitHub Issue](https://github.com/Nusrath/ProHint/issues/new) and describe
your problem or suggestion. We welcome all kinds of feedback regarding
ProHint including but not limited to:

 * When ProHint doesn't work as expected
 * When ProHint complains about valid JavaScript code that works in all browsers
 * When you simply want a new option or feature

Before reporting a bug look around to see if there are any open or closed tickets
that cover your issue. And remember the wisdom: pull request > bug report > tweet.
